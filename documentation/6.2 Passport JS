Passport JS

There are only two components you will need to remember about Passport JS components/libraries:


Obs.: 	1. If you do not have any folder/file mentioned into this documentation means that you need to create it.
		2. The files created by this documentaion, needs to be created into the index.js file.


	> Passport
		It is the library responsible to handle the authentication

	> Passport Strategies
		Passport allows you to login at any specific Site that implements the OAuth authenticantion flow, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Github, etc. 

	1. Intalling Passport JS and Google Strategy 

		> Go to your terminal and type:

			$ npm install --save passport passport-google-oauth20

	2. Configuring Passport

		At your /services/passport.js file do the following:

		> Import library and Strategy

			_. const passport = require('passport');
			_. const GoogleStrategy = require('passport-google-oauth20').Strategy;

		> Configure the Passport with the Google Strategy

			_. passport.use(new GoogleStrategy());	


	3. Configuring the App to be able to send authentication requests to Google

		> Go to http://console.developers.google.com/

		> After you have loged in, create a New Project. We will create one named 'Node Google OAuth Raw Project'

		> After your project have been created, select it.

		> Then enable the Google API to be able to handle OAuth 

			1. Click on "Enable APIs and Services"

			2. Search for "Google+ API" (yes! Google+ instead of OAuth ¬¬) and click on that.

			3. Click on "Enable API"

		> Configuring the OAuth Credentials

			1. After it has been enabled, go to Credentials menu, click on "Create Credentials" and into the oppened menu, click on the "OAuth client ID".

			2. After "OAuth client ID" has already been enabled, click on the "Configure consent screen", and:

				> Configure the "Product name shown to users", click on save

				> As Application Type, select "Web Application", and on its configurations do the following:

					> On Restrictions/Authorized JavaScript origins, add:

						http://localhost:5000

						obs.: the same port you have configured into your application.

					> On Restrictions/Authorized redirect URIs, add:

						http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback

					> Click on Create

				> A popup will be shown with the ClientID and the ClientSecret, copy and save them into a secure local.						
					We have saved the these Ids into /config/dev.js (it wasn't commited, you must create it). 

					TAKE CARE TO NEVER COMMIT YOUR CLIENT SECRET ID!!! 

					So add dev.js to your .ignore file.

					You always will be able to get your Client ID and your Client Secret again on http://console.developers.google.com/.

		> Configuring our code to use Google OAuth

			1. Open our /services/passport.js file again and:

				> Import the configured keys file /config/keys.js

				> Adjust the 'passport.use(...)' code with the following:

					passport.use(
					    new GoogleStrategy(
					        {
					            clientID: keys.googleClientID,
					            clientSecret: keys.googleClientSecret,
					            callbackURL: '/auth/google/callback'
					        },
					        accessToken => {
					            console.log(accessToken);
					        }
					    )
					);

					It will use our keys e configure the callback to receive the Google Token, sent back to the app after the requested grant access permition.

				> Configure the ROUTE to make the passport authentication

					Into /routes/authRoutes.js, after the code above, do the following:

						app.get(
						    '/auth/google', 
						    passport.authenticate('google', {
						        scope: ['profile', 'email']
						    })
						);

		> Configuring the OAuth Credentials / Restrictions/Authorized redirect URIs

			This configuration is needed it allow Google send the grants permition to our configured callback. 
			Without this configuration, you will have an error like 
				> 400. That’s an error.
				> Error: redirect_uri_mismatch

			> So, go back to your http://console.developers.google.com/
			> Open the Credentials
			> Add to Restrictions/ Authorized redirect URIs the path:
				http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback

				Note that, /auth/google/callback is the same path configured at GoogleStrategy/callbackURL.

		> Adding route to handle the google auth callback into our code

			Go to the /routes/authRoutes.js and add the code below:

				app.get(
				    '/auth/google/callback',
				    passport.authenticate('google')
				);
