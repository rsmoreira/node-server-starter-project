Body Parser - Handling request payload into the Back End

	When you make post requests, sending a payload request to your Back End, ExpressJs doesn't default pars the request payload. 
	
	You must to install a library to do it. 
	
	It is done by 'body-parser'. 

	It is a middleware library.

	Installing 

		$ npm install --save body-parser

	Configuring 

		Into the Server 'index.js' file, import and configure it as the follow. 

		Obs.: as it is a middleware library, it must be configured into the 'app.use' function.

		...
		const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); 
		...
		app.use(bodyParser.json());
		... 


		DONE!

	After you have it configured, every payload request (put/patch/post request) will be intercepted by this middleware, the body will be parsed and the result will be put into the 'prop.body' property of the incomming request object.
