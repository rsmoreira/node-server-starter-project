	This session manager is kept in the server side. 
	The default server-side session storage is the the MemoryStorage, however it must be avoid in production due to memory leak. 
	In production environment you must configure a Compatible Session Storage. As we have used mongo, the most known is the 
	connect-mongo (https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo).
