Sessio Cookies

A Session Cookie will help to keep us authenticated into the Application. So you won't need to perform an authentication every single request made from the front end to the back end. 

To do that, we will be using the Cookie-session library. 

OBS.: 
	The cookie-session is a simple cookie manager used for lightweight apps and development.
	Cookie-session keeps your cookies in the browser and must be avoid if you must keep complex data into the cookies. 
	For a complex session manager, please, take a look at '10.1 Session Cookies - express-session'. 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session

With this library you can wire up the use of the Session Cookies into your app (into the express), so after you already have authenticated, through any authentication mode, this middleware will intercept the authentication callback and inject its data into your application cookies. 

Remember, at this point, you already must have, in our case, your Passport and Google Strategy configured and its callback functions as well.

So lets start:

	Installing

		First thing you must to do is to install, so open your Terminal and from the application root path, execute the following command:

			$ npm install --save cookie-session

	Configuring Passport to serialize and deserialize the cookie data

		Configuring passport to treat the Cookie serialization and deserialization.

		THESE PIECE OF CODE IS WHAT PASSPORT USES TO ADD DATA INTO THE COOKIE!

		The 'user' is the retrieved/authenticated user that we have work with on our GoogleStrategy callback function.

		So, into your passport.js file, add the following:

			passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
			    // This user.id, is the id generated on the Users Collection, on MongoDB.
			    // It isn't the profile.id.
			    done(null, user.id);
			});

			passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
			    User.findById(id)
			        .then(user => {
			            done(null, user);
			        });
			});

	Adding the session-cookie to your app

		From index.js add the following code

			// import cookie-session and passport
			const cookieSession = require('cookie-session');
			const passport = require('passport');

			// configure the cookie-session attributes into your app (after 'const app = express()')
			app.use(
			    cookieSession({
			        maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
			        keys: [keys.cookieKey]
			    })
			);

			// configure passport to manage these session data 
			app.use(passport.initialize());
			app.use(passport.session());

	DONE

Take a look that when you are using 'app.use', means that you are injecting some funtion as a 'middleware' into your application. In other words, your are adding an 'interceptor', in this case, that will take care of your session cookies data.

>> cookie-session VS express-session 

COOKIE-SESSION

	In this application, we are using cookie-session, because we just need to keep the user-id into the cookie. It has only 4KB of capacity and it doesn't manage the session storage. 

	The cookie IS the session.

	Cookie-session is a simple / lightweight cookie-based (cookie is the only storage engine supported: all the session info is stored on the client, in a cookie) session implementation.

EXPRESS-SESSION
	(https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)

	In a real world is recommended to use the Express-session, because it gives access, and manage, the Express Session Storage. So, you will be able to hold any kind of data there. You won't be limited to 4KB as Cookie-Session is.

	Basically, express-session is more abstract, it supports different session stores (like files, DB, cache and whatnot).
