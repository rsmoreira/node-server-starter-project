MongoDB

	In MongoDB we have Collections and each Collection has its Records. 

		In relational databases...
			** Collection = Table 
			** Record = Object

	MongoDB is a schemeless database. That means, each object into a Collection can have its own list of attributes. It is refered as a Non-Relational database as well. 

	Mongoose.js is Javascript library to help us TO REPRESENT THE MONGO DB STRUCTURE OF DATA (Collections and Records). 

	Mongoose / Model Class

		In Mongoose, a Model Class is a Javascript object used to represent an entire MongoDB Collection. 

	Mongoose / Model Instance

		In Mongoose, a Model Instance is a Javascript object used to represent each MongoDB Record.
