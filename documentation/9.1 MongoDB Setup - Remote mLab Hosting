	Creating a New Database on MLAB

	Configuring your Database

		> After you have created your database, at your mLab home page, you will see this database, click on it.

			You will see the instructions to connect to your database, something like 


				To connect using the mongo shell:
					> mongo ds141474.mlab.com:41474/node-google-oauth-db -u <dbuser> -p <dbpassword>
				
				To connect using a driver via the standard MongoDB URI (what's this?):
					> mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds141474.mlab.com:41474/node-google-oauth-db

		> Here, the first thing to do is to CREATE A NEW USER for this database

			1. So, click on 'Users' and on 'Add database user'. 
				This database user will be our admin. 
				I've saved username and the passwork at lastpass.com. I strongly recommend you to do that.
