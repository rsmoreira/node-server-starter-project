Assuming that you already have NODE properly installed into your machine, create the NODE project and Install Express.

1. Creating the NODE Project

	> Into your command line, go to your workspace or repository path and create a new folder with a proper name
		_:~$ mkdir %project-name%

	> Access this project and create a new directory named 'server' 
		_:~$ mkdir server

	> Create your project using the NPM proper command

		_:~$ npm init

		After this you will be asked to do some customizations into your project, to just have the default information into your project, just hit the enter until the end. 

		At the end, you will have a 'package.json' file into your project. It is used to your central hub of all your dependencies you will have into your project. 

	> Install your first dependency: EXPRESS 

		_:~$ npm install --save express

	> To check if Express was correctly installed and saved into your package.json

		_:~$ cat package.json

		And look for 'express' into the 'dependencies' area.
