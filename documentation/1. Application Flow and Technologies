[This is the flow description of a greater project, into this project we will implement just until the first step: 1. Google OAuth]

With this project, an user will be able to Sign in with Google OAuth and will be able to create a survey asking feedback for any kind of topic. So, the user will be able to create a list of questions, create a list of e-mails and send this questions (the survey) to this list. Each person of this e-mail list will receive an e-mail with a link, to collect its feedback. After the feedback is filled correctly and submitted, the owner of the survey will be able to check the feedbacks and generate reports.
