At this point we have two remote repositories created:

    The GITHUB repository

    The HEROKU resository 

So, we need to still sending code the the both! At least I need to do that!!!!

    Before pushing your code to Github and Heroku, take care if your have added and commited your code to your local reposoty:
        $ git status
        $ git add *
        $ git commit -m "commit message"

    1. GITHUB

        Just still doing the samething you have done so far:

            $ git push

    2. HEROKU

        Just execute the following command to commit your code to Heroku

            $ git push heroku master
