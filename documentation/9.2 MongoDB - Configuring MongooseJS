Mongoose.js

Mongoose is a JS Library used to interact with MongoDB. 
Remember that, Mongoose has the Model Class components to interact with the MongoDB Collections, and that has the Model Instances to interact with MongoDB Records. 

	> Installing Mongoose

		Open your terminal and from your project base path run the command below:

			$ npm install --save mongoose

	> Add Mongoose to your index.js

		Import Mongoose

			const mongoose = require('mongoose');

	> Configuring Mongoose 

		Configure the URI at your /config/dev.js (for Dev environment) 
		Or at your Deployment Application under the key MONGO_URI (for Prod Environment).
		You can get this URI at your mLab space

			...
			// Below is just an example, you will have another URI
			mongoURI : 'mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds141474.mlab.com:41474/node-google-oauth-db'

			Don't forget to update the dbuser and the dbpassword with the database admin created on mLab for this database.

		Into your index.js

			Import the keys.js, and 

			mongoose.connect(keys.mongoURI);
