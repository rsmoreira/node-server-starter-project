Refactorying the Project Structure

Here we will be just adjusting our files to update the Project Struture to seam like the struture proposed at the file 11.1 Refactorying the Project Structure.pdf.

	As you have seen, the project has already been reestructured, but here we have created the files 

		/routes/authRoutes.js - responsible to keep any app.get route responsible to handle Authentications. 

		/services/passport.js - responsible to keep all the passport configuration, with any strategy needed.

	After these code is moved, you need to adjust index.js to import them:

		require('../services/passport')
			here we just need to import the file, we do not need to assign it to a const, because we won't call any function of it.

		const authRoutes = require('../routes/authRoutes');

A special atention to the file /routes/authRoutes.js. There is needed to access the 'app' created into the index.js file. 

Into the file /routes/authRoutes.js, all code that needs to be accessed by the 'app' must be between the curly braces of the code below:

	module.exports = (app) => {
		app.get(...);
		app.get(...);

	};

Into the file index.js, after the app is already created (const app = express();) add the following code:

	authRoutes(app);

		It will send our just created 'app' to our 'module.exports' piece of code.

We can also suppress the const authRoutes, and just call authRoutes code like this:

	require('./routes/authRoutes')(app);
