Google OAuth and Passport JS


Before start reading this doc, please take a look at the "8.1 Google OAuth - Authentication Flow Diagram.pdf". It's very important to understand what Google OAuth and Passport JS does for us. 

Believing that you already have took a look there, here we go. Ok, I will even write everything again below as well.

Below, the Google OAuth Authentication Flow. 
Take a look that PASSPORT will handle to us all the Communication between Our Back End and the Google! 
Steps from 2 util 7. Voila! 

	01. [Our Front End] 			
		- User clicks into the "Login with Google" button
	
	02. [Our Back End > GOOGLE]	- PASSPORT
		- Our server receives this request and send this request to GOOGLE (with the e-mail, obiouslly)
	03. [GOOGLE] - PASSPORT				
		- Google will work verifying with the user, the e-mail's owner, if he allows our application accessging its Google's data. 
		- The user will receive an e-mail or a new tab will open into its default browser where Google will be asking if he allows our application accessing its Google information.
	04. [GOOGLE] - PASSPORT
		- Google will receive the use's response, checking if the user grants the permition. 
	05. [GOOGLE > Our Back End] - PASSPORT
		- After this grant access permition (steps 3 and 4), Google will send a Google Code with the permition to Our Back End. 
	06. [Our Back End > GOOGLE] - PASSPORT
		- Our Back End will receive this response and will check if it was positive. 
		- For positive responses from Google, Our Back End will send to Google a request to receive the Google's Data of the user. This request includes the Google Code received into the step 5.  
	07. [GOOGLE > Our Back End]- PASSPORT 
		- Google, with the Google Code received, will retrieve the Use's Data into its database and send it to Our Back End. 
	
	08. [Our Back End]
		- Our Back End, with the User's Google's Data, will persist these informations into our Database.
	
	09. [Our Back End]
		- Our Back End will also Set the User ID (from Google) into the Cookies.

	10. [Our Back End > Our Front End]
		- Our Back End will send the Google Authentication response to Our Front End. It can be positive or negative, keep it in mind.

	11. [Our Front End > Our Back End]
		- Once a time our application already have the User ID (from Google), setted into the step 09, correctly configured into the Cookies, ALL OTHER REQUESTS WILL USE THIS ID AS A AUTHENTICATION.
